# Siko Sink Cap

I'm missing a piece from my sink cap, so I'm going to print a replacement of it.

## To-Do

### Buy the printer

It costs as much built as the build-it-yourself version on the Prusa website:

### Switch the workflow to Aptitude when Ubuntu 19.04 is available in runners

On 18.04 and 16.04 OpenSCAD is not available out of the box and the backpoints
repository has a version from 2015, which hangs when rendering in headless mode.

On 19.04, OpenSCAD is supposed to be included in the box in a recent version:

`sudo apt-get install openscad`
